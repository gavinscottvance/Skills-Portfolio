# Skills-Portfolio

Brief Overview

I am Ph.D candidate majoring in Research Psychology. I am entering into my final semester, and I am scheduled to defend my dissertation in late February, 2024. My research focuses broadly on evolved psychology, and in particular, on sexual dysfunction, intimate partner violence, and determinants of semen quality. My experience conducting psychological research has involved the use of various statistical methods, including regression, means testing (t-tests and ANOVAs), path analysis (especially mediation and moderation), and data reduction (confirmatory and exploratory factor analyses). My graduate research has also allowed me to develop my skills in both written communication (scientific reports published in scholarly journals) and oral communication (presentations at academic conferences). Through this work, I have also advanced my skills in data visualization.
