This folder contains R code for conducting means tests (e.g., t-tests, ANOVAs). 

The data for the t-test code are presented in my publication "Later Life Sex Differences in Sexual Psychology and Behavior" (Vance et al., 2020). The code used in this github repository uses the raw data file with no exlusions, so the results presented here will be different from those presented in the original publication.
