# Data Cleaning

This folder contains a few brief examples of data cleaning procedures in R:
  Creating standardized variables (z-scores) to identify univariate outliers
  Using Mahalanobis Distance to identify multivariate outliers
  Identifying inconsistent responders using inter-item standard deviation

These procedures are helpful for identifying problematic cases in a data file, such as outliers and inconsistent responders.

The data used in these examples were collected via Prolific using funds provided by my academic advisor at Oakland University. Because we have not yet published with these data, they will not be made publicly available at this time.
